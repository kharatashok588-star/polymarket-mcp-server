## 📝 Code Standards

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- **Line length**: 100 characters (not 79)
- **Imports**: Group by standard library, third-party, local
- **Type hints**: Use type hints for all function signatures
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings for all public functions

```python
def example_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> dict:
    """
    Brief description of what the function does.

    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2

    Returns:
        Description of return value

    Raises:
        ValueError: When something goes wrong
    """
    pass
```

### Code Quality Tools

Before submitting, run:

```bash
# Format code
black src/

# Lint
ruff check src/

# Type checking (optional but recommended)

```

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_trading_tools.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=polymarket_mcp --cov-report=html

# Run only fast tests (skip integration tests)
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Writing Tests

- **All tests must use real Polymarket APIs** (NO MOCKS per project policy)
- Use `pytest` framework
- Place tests in `/tests/` directory
- Name test files `test_*.py`
- Each new feature should include corresponding tests

Example test structure:

```python
import pytest
from polymarket_mcp.tools import your_module

async def test_your_feature():
    """Test description"""
    result = await your_module.your_function()
    assert result is not None
    assert result['key'] == 'expected_value'
```
